# LZJ-s-Galaxy-Trip
source code of rom, ASM files and rmobjs of my hack LGT.
but many codes are testing code so it's possible that it can't work when you import them to rom. Or you can just download the decomp pj64 to see codes in rom.
See tutorial for how to move objects to your rom and basic knowledge of behaviors and ASM.
