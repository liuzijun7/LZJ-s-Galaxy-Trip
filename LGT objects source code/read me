Source codes of all the objects in LGT.
Remember not all the codes work correctly in that file. So please try if it's useful. Also some comments are written in Chinese so if you have any problem, just contact me. 
Thing I can promise is all the objects and codes used in the rom should work well and the basic code function example (which is most useful) is right.
